### **NLP** 

- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for [Bixby](https://web.archive.org/web/20210131060707/https://www.samsung.com/us/explore/bixby/) Bengali**.
  * Conducted in [**Samsung Research, Bangladesh**](https://web.archive.org/web/20201020003706/https://research.samsung.com/srbd)

  Scope: [SRBD]((https://web.archive.org/web/20201020003706/https://research.samsung.com/srbd)) [Icon of The month](https://github.com/ShihabYasin/shihabyasin.github.io/blob/gh-pages/public/img/srbd-iom.jpeg) (July-August 2018) for outstanding contribution to the development of Bangla ASR PoC, participation on an international NLP Workshop in Jordan and inauguration of a collaborative ASR project with BUET professor [Muhammad Abdullah Adnan, PhD](https://web.archive.org/web/20201022201402/https://sites.google.com/site/abdullahadnan/ ) and his students on the development of a full scale Bangla ASR for Samsung Electronics.
Published a research paper for Samsung titled ["Customizing Grapheme-to-Phoneme System for Non-Trivial Transcription Problems in Bangla Language" on North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL-HLT 2019), At Minneapolis, USA.]((https://web.archive.org/web/20200705150821/https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1322/))
Guided some interns achieving their project goals on time.


- **[Context Based Search Using LDA Topic Modelling Algorithm](https://github.com/ShihabYasin/LDA-to-Context-Based-Search)**

  **LDA** is a machine learning algorithm that extracts topics and their related keywords from a collection of documents. Using these information about different documents it is possible to do context based file searching according their relevance with search keyword or document classification based on their context.
  In LDA, a document may contain several different topics, each with their own related terms. The algorithm uses a probabilistic model for detecting the number of topics specified and extracting their related keywords. For example, a document may contain topics that could be classified as beach-related and weather-related. The beach topic may contain related words, such as sand, ocean, and water. Similarly, the weather topic may contain related words, such as sun, temperature, and clouds.


- **Spatio Temporal Relation Extraction From Online News Corpora In Different Languages.** 
   
   Scope: **Relation Extraction** (spatial and temporal together, person-location-time ) from raw web news text in different languages(English, German, Hindi). Different Natural Language Processing techniques and Machine Learning techniques are exercised. **Feature Engineering** was the most critical part that I had already designed common to all experimenting languages. Experimented with **Support Vector Machines** and later **Ensemble Learning**. Before that I designed specialized **annotation scheme** to be applied on collected web data and finally collected in extensible markup language format for further application and improvement. [Here some resources about this project.](https://github.com/ShihabYasin/Person-Location-Time-Association-by-Classification)
   
   This project was from [Language Technologies Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) under supervision of [Judith Gelernter, PhD](https://web.archive.org/web/20200923140503/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gelernter/)


- **Isolated Bangla Word Recognition** and **Speaker Detection** by Semantic Modular Time Delay **Neural Network**.

    Scope: Developed a Neural Network model for Bengali isolated acoustic words recognition on a collected corpus. I used concepts from **Neuroscience** and **brain research** with the application of **Natural Language Processing** techniques and Neural Network as **Machine Learning** approach. Neural network were designed in such a modular way that every **module had some semantic role** with time delay receptors for increasing experiences with time.   [Here some resources about this project.](https://github.com/ShihabYasin/Isolated-Bengali-Word-and-Speaker-Recognition.).


- **Extracting Semantic Relatedness For Bangla Words.**
   
   A framework for extracting **semantic relational words** in Bangla is presented in this project. Here extraction of **Synonyms, Antonyms, Hyponym, Hypernym, Meronym, Holonym** and **Polysemy** are primarily investigated as a rule based model. For every word two other things: concept and parts of speech category are also presented for clarification. A **semantic analyzer** is used to extract these relations from nouns, adjectives and verbs.

- **Deep-Scaly-Neural-Network-to-recognize-Continuous-Bengali-Sentence.**
   
   Scope: **Speaker recognition** is the identiﬁcation of a person from characteristics of his/her voices and speech recognition concerns the recognizing of what is being said by the speaker.This Project presents a framework to recognize the isolated Bangla words and the corresponding speaker by proposing a semantic **modular time delay neural network** (MTDNN). Underlying acoustic fuzziness of human utterance and ﬂuctuations of data due to environmental disturbance are managed by well-known **Fuzzy C Means clustering** technique. We have used MFCC features to recognize Bangla words and speaker detection. Experimental result with different individuals show that the proposed framework is functioning quite satisfactory with average accuracy of 82.66%.

### **AI**

- [An intelligent Android-ColorPhun-Game-Agent-Using-Deeplearning to play autonomously.](https://github.com/ShihabYasin/Android-ColorPhun-Game-Agent-Using-Deeplearning)
  
  This game was played against a trained AI agent by a Human player.


### **Plasma Physics**

- **Solitary and periodic wave solutions of the fourth order Boussinesq equation through the novel exponential expansion method.**

   Worked with [M. Golam Hafez](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Md-Hafez). Simulating mathematical structure of different types built on different theories of **Particle Physics** using **Partial Differential Equation**, getting useful data, analyzing graphically and statistically those data for further **analysis and visualization**.  Also contributed theoretically on some aspects of the above mentioned novel method.
