### **Algorithm**

1. [Transitive Closure Using Path Algebra Algorithm. Published on International Journal of Computer Science Issues, pp. 8-11, Volume 13, Issue 2, March 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721023932/https://www.ijcsi.org/papers/IJCSI-13-2-8-11.pdf).

Scope: Basic problem of finding transitive closure is dealt with Max-Plus Idempotent semiring and Idempotent Mathematics. A simple algorithm is described that can calculate transitive closure of graphs using Path Algebra or MaxPlus Algebra. Simple methods of linear algebra are used for different levels of computation.


2. [Using Prefix Reversals To Looplessly Generate O (1) Time Multiset Permutation By Boustrophedon Linked List](https://github.com/ShihabYasin/shihabyasin.github.io/blob/gh-pages/public/files/time-generation.pdf)

Scope: Rigorous mathematical proof constructed for theoretical verification of proposed Algorithm. Simulation results also presented for empirical justifications.


3. [Simulating mathematical structure of different types built on different theories of Particle Physics using Partial Differential Equation, getting useful data, analyzing graphically and statistically those data for further analysis and visualization.  Also contributed theoretically on some aspects of the above mentioned novel method.](https://github.com/ShihabYasin/Research-on-Plasma-Physics/blob/master/BSS%20EQN%20MATERIALS_PAPER_.pdf)
Worked with [M. Golam Hafez, M. Phill, PhD](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Md-Hafez).


### **Complexity Theory & Computer Hardware**

1. [Hardware Designation for Scaling P=NP Problem. Published in International Journal of Computer Science Issues, pp. 85-88, Volume 13, Issue 1, January 2016, doi:10.20943/IJCSI-201602-8588](https://web.archive.org/web/20200725213624/http://www.ijcsi.org/papers/IJCSI-13-1-85-88.pdf)

Scope: This paper devised an algorithm or Turing machine equivalent that is reasonably sufficient to cope with the P=NP problem. Some hardware assistance may enable us to get a better solution in this respect. In general it shows some analogy that can deal with non-determinism effectively and presents some analogical transformation to make a more powerful solid state computing device.


### **Software Engineering**

1. [A Simple Software Engineering Environment for Coming Decades. Published on International Journal of Education and Management  Engineering(IJEME), Vol.7, No.1,pp.46-53, 2017. DOI: 10.5815/ijeme.2017.01.05](https://web.archive.org/web/20180720083202/http://www.mecs-press.org/ijeme/ijeme-v7-n1/IJEME-V7-N1-5.pdf)

Scope: A software engineering standard of collaborative development (like JetBrains Space, Jupyter Notebook) is proposed for the coming days considering large geographical regions with different cultures, coordination among team members, platform security, code review, weight of participation of individuals, pair programming, fast and cost effective development, SDLC, time critical fix/delivery etc.


### **Plasma Physics**

- **Solitary and periodic wave solutions of the fourth order Boussinesq equation through the novel exponential expansion method.**

Worked with [M. Golam Hafez](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Md-Hafez). Simulating mathematical structure of different types built on different theories of **Particle Physics** using **Partial Differential Equation**, getting useful data, analyzing graphically and statistically those data for further **analysis and visualization**.  Also contributed theoretically on some aspects of the above mentioned novel method. [Here some resources about this project.](https://github.com/ShihabYasin/Research-on-Plasma-Physics)
