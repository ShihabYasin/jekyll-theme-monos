## A Simple-Blog-App-Using-Django-and-Elasticsearch: 

### This project will consist of multiple models, which will be serialized and served via <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django REST Framework</a>.


We'll be building a simple blog application. Our project will consist of multiple models, which will be serialized and served via Django REST Framework. After integrating Elasticsearch, we'll create an endpoint that will allow us to look up different authors, categories, and articles.

To keep our code clean and modular, we'll split our project into the following two apps:

1. ```blog``` - for our Django models, serializers, and ViewSets
2. ```search``` - for Elasticsearch documents, indexes, and queries


Start by creating a new directory and setting up a new Django project:

<pre><span></span><code>$ mkdir django-drf-elasticsearch <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> django-drf-elasticsearch
$ python3.9 -m venv env
$ <span class="nb">source</span> env/bin/activate

<span class="o">(</span>env<span class="o">)</span>$ pip install <span class="nv">django</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="m">3</span>.2.6
<span class="o">(</span>env<span class="o">)</span>$ django-admin.py startproject core .
</code></pre>
