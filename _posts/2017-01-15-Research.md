### **NLP** 

1. [Customizing Grapheme-to-Phoneme System for Non-Trivial Transcription Problems in Bangla Language
publication dateFeb 2019  publication descriptionNorth American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL-HLT 2019), At Minneapolis, USA.](https://web.archive.org/web/20200705150821/https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1322/)

   * Conducted in [**Samsung Research, Bangladesh**](https://web.archive.org/web/20201020003706/https://research.samsung.com/srbd)
   * Got [**SRBD**]((https://web.archive.org/web/20201020003706/https://research.samsung.com/srbd)) [**Icon of The month**](https://github.com/ShihabYasin/shihabyasin.github.io/blob/gh-pages/public/img/srbd-iom.jpeg) (July-August 2018)

   Scope: Grapheme to phoneme (G2P) conversion is an integral part of various text and speech processing systems, such as Text to Speech system, Speech Recognition system, etc. The existing methodologies for G2P conversion in Bangla language are mostly rule-based. However, data-driven approaches have proved their superiority over rule-based approaches for large-scale G2P conversion in other languages, such as English, German, etc. As the performance of data-driven approaches for G2P conversion depend largely on pronunciation lexicon on which the system is trained, in this paper, we investigate on developing an improved training lexicon by identifying and categorizing the critical cases in Bangla language and include those critical cases in training lexicon for developing a robust G2P conversion system in Bangla language. Additionally, we have incorporated nasal vowels in our proposed phoneme list. Our methodology outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches for G2P conversion in Bangla language.


2. [Isolated Bangla Word Recognition and Speaker Detection by Semantic Modular Time Delay Neural Network (MTDNN), pp-560-565, 18th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT), 21-23 December, 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20180611013044/https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7488134/).

    Scope: Developed a Deep Neural Network model for Bengali isolated acoustic words recognition over a collected corpus. Accumulated concept from Neuroscience and brain research with the application of Natural Language Processing techniques and custom Deep Neural Network. Deep Neural Architecture was designed in such a modular way that every module had some semantic role with time delay functionalities for increasing experiences over time.

3. [Extracting semantic relatedness for Bangla words, Technically Co-sponsored by IEEE, IEEE CS, IEICE, IEEE TC-PAMI, IEEJ, JSME, JIN, U of Hyogo
publication dateMay 2016  publication description5th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV)](https://web.archive.org/web/20180622095224/https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7760034/)
   
   Scope: Developed a framework for extracting semantic relational words in Bengali. Extraction of Synonyms, Antonyms, Hyponym, Hypernym, Meronym, Holonym and Polysemy are primarily investigated as a rule based model. For every word two other features: word concept(customized feature vector) and parts of speech category are also presented for clarification. Developed a semantic analyzer to extract these relations from nouns, adjectives and verbs.

### **Algorithm** 

1. [Transitive Closure Using Path Algebra Algorithm. Published on International Journal of Computer Science Issues, pp. 8-11, Volume 13, Issue 2, March 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721023932/https://www.ijcsi.org/papers/IJCSI-13-2-8-11.pdf). 
   
   Scope: Basic problem of finding transitive closure is dealt with Max-Plus Idempotent semiring and Idempotent Mathematics. A simple algorithm is described that can calculate transitive closure of graphs using Path Algebra or MaxPlus Algebra. Simple methods of linear algebra are used for different levels of computation.


2. [Using Prefix Reversals To Looplessly Generate O (1) Time Multiset Permutation By Boustrophedon Linked List](https://github.com/ShihabYasin/shihabyasin.github.io/blob/gh-pages/public/files/time-generation.pdf)
   
   Scope: Rigorous mathematical proof constructed for theoretical verification of proposed Algorithm. Simulation results also presented for empirical justifications.


3. [Simulating mathematical structure of different types built on different theories of Particle Physics using Partial Differential Equation, getting useful data, analyzing graphically and statistically those data for further analysis and visualization.  Also contributed theoretically on some aspects of the above mentioned novel method.](https://github.com/ShihabYasin/Research-on-Plasma-Physics/blob/master/BSS%20EQN%20MATERIALS_PAPER_.pdf)

### **Complexity Theory & Computer Hardware**

1. [Hardware Designation for Scaling P=NP Problem. Published in International Journal of Computer Science Issues, pp. 85-88, Volume 13, Issue 1, January 2016, doi:10.20943/IJCSI-201602-8588](https://web.archive.org/web/20200725213624/http://www.ijcsi.org/papers/IJCSI-13-1-85-88.pdf)
   
   Scope: This paper devised an algorithm or Turing machine equivalent that is reasonably sufficient to cope with the P=NP problem. Some hardware assistance may enable us to get a better solution in this respect. In general it shows some analogy that can deal with non-determinism effectively and presents some analogical transformation to make a more powerful solid state computing device.


### **Software Engineering**

1. [A Simple Software Engineering Environment for Coming Decades. Published on International Journal of Education and Management  Engineering(IJEME), Vol.7, No.1,pp.46-53, 2017. DOI: 10.5815/ijeme.2017.01.05](https://web.archive.org/web/20180720083202/http://www.mecs-press.org/ijeme/ijeme-v7-n1/IJEME-V7-N1-5.pdf)
   
   Scope: A software engineering standard of collaborative development (like JetBrains Space, Jupyter Notebook) is proposed for the coming days considering large geographical regions with different cultures, coordination among team members, platform security, code review, weight of participation of individuals, pair programming, fast and cost effective development, SDLC, time critical fix/delivery etc.
